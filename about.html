      <p class="information">
        All living things are made of carbon. Carbon is also a part of the
        ocean, air, and even rocks. Because the Earth is a dynamic place, carbon
        does not stay still. It is on the move! In the atmosphere, carbon is
        attached to some oxygen in a gas called carbon dioxide. Plants use
        carbon dioxide and sunlight to make their own food and grow. The carbon
        becomes part of the plant. Plants that die and are buried may turn into
        fossil fuels made of carbon like coal and oil over millions of years.
        When humans burn fossil fuels, most of the carbon quickly enters the
        atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and
        traps heat in the atmosphere. Without it and other greenhouse gases,
        Earth would be a frozen world. But humans have burned so much fuel that
        there is about 30% more carbon dioxide in the air today than there was
        about 150 years ago, and Earth is becoming a warmer place. In fact, ice
        cores show us that there is now more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
        than there has been in the last 420,000 years.

        Local sources of GHG
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Transportation (28.2 percent of 2018 greenhouse gas emissions) – The
          transportation sector generates the largest share of greenhouse gas
          emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation primarily come
          from burning fossil fuel for our cars, trucks, ships, trains, and
          planes. Over 90 percent of the fuel used for transportation is
          petroleum based, which includes primarily gasoline and diesel.2
        </li>
        <li>
          Electricity production (26.9 percent of 2018 greenhouse gas emissions)
          – Electricity production generates the second largest share of
          greenhouse gas emissions. Approximately 63 percent of our electricity
          comes from burning fossil fuels, mostly coal and natural gas.3
        </li>
        <li>
          Industry (22.0 percent of 2018 greenhouse gas emissions) – Greenhouse
          gas emissions from industry primarily come from burning fossil fuels
          for energy, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from certain chemical
          reactions necessary to produce goods from raw materials.
        </li>
        <li>
          Commercial and Residential (12.3 percent of 2018 greenhouse gas
          emissions) – Greenhouse gas emissions from businesses and homes arise
          primarily from fossil fuels burned for heat, the use of certain
          products that contain greenhouse gases, and the handling of waste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Agriculture (9.9 percent of 2018 greenhouse gas emissions) –
          Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture come from livestock such as
          cows, agricultural soils, and rice production.
        </li>
        <li>
          Land Use and Forestry (11.6 percent of 2018 greenhouse gas emissions)
          – Land areas can act as a sink (absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere) or
          a source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, since
          1990, managed forests and other lands are a net sink, i.e. they have
          absorbed more CO2 from the atmosphere than they emit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="red-heading">Emissions and Trends</h3>
      <p class="information">
        Since 1990, gross U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 3.7
        percent. From year to year, emissions can rise and fall due to changes
        in the economy, the price of fuel, and other factors. In 2018, U.S.
        greenhouse gas emissions increased compared to 2017 levels. The increase
        in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion was a result of multiple
        factors, including increased energy use due to greater heating and
        cooling needs due to a colder winter and hotter summer in 2018 compared
        to 2017.

        Main sources of carbon emissions
      </h3>
      <p class="information">
        There are both natural and human sources of carbon dioxide emissions.
        Natural sources include decomposition, ocean release and respiration.
        Human sources come from activities like cement production, deforestation
        as well as the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas.
        Due to human activities, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide
        has been rising extensively since the Industrial Revolution and has now
        reached dangerous levels not seen in the last 3 million years.1 2 3
        Human sources of carbon dioxide emissions are much smaller than natural
        emissions but they have upset the natural balance that existed for many
        thousands of years before the influence of humans. This is because
        natural sinks remove around the same quantity of carbon dioxide from the
        atmosphere than are produced by natural sources.4 This had kept carbon
        dioxide levels balanced and in a safe range. But human sources of
        emissions have upset the natural balance by adding extra carbon dioxide
        to the atmosphere without removing any

    <p class="information">
      Solving climate change is a huge international challenge. Only a concerted global effort, involving the governments of all nations, will be enough to avert dangerous consequences. But that said, the individual actions of everyday people are still crucial. Large and complex issues, like climate change, are usually best tackled by breaking down the problem into manageable bits.
For carbon emissions, this means reducing the CO2 contribution of each and every one of the six and a half billion people on the planet.

      Here's what we can do:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Make climate-conscious political decisions</li>
      <li>Purchase “green electricity“</li>
      <li>Make your home and household energy efficient</li>
      <li>Buy energy and water efficient appliances</li>
